  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Oliver Chen I am a student at Columbia College Chicago. I am majoring in Game Design with a minor in
    Programming. I have a deep love for strategy, sandbox games, and modding. Some of my favorites are <i>Rimworld</i>, 
    <i>Slay the spire</i>, and <i>Baldur's Gate 3</i>. Currently, I am working on my capstone project <i>Arcana Forge</i>
    which is heavily inspired by <i>Slay the Spire</i> and other roguelikes.(You can check out the project 
    <b><a href="https://mollark.itch.io/arcana-forge" target="_blank">here</a></b>)

    Some of my other interests include Brandon Samderson's Cosmere Universe book series, 
    manga and other comic mediums, and badminton.
